# restful-web-services



## Getting started

This project was created during the Spring Boot, REST APIs and JPA course.

It contains multiple APIs and chapters combined in the same project, but these
chapters are not linked. Each package in the `./src` directory is associated with
a distinct chapter.

The final and most interesting chapter can be found in the `apk` package,
which represents a simple `REST API` project, which communicates with a `H2`
local database.
The user can create, delete, retrieve users or posts for these users using
appropriate API calls.
